More advanced components (e.g. rootkits) would likely require C/C++ to interact with syscalls. But for our **keylogger**, we stick to Python.

- ***Target OS*** : The testbed environment is a **Windows-based environment**. We restrict our testing and simulations to this OS only.

- ***Functionalities*** :
    - **Keylogging** using Python modules (e.g., `pynput`)
    - **Screenshot capture**
    - **Data exfiltration simulation** (e.g., sending to a Telegram bot)

- ***Attacker-side simulation*** : Logs and screenshots are sent to a **local server or Telegram bot**. We explore the idea of using AI for future parsing but do not implement it at this stage.

- ***Detection & Stealth*** : The key focus of this experience is **evasion**. Building the logger is not the challenge; staying undetected is. Thus, we also investigate:
    - How AV solutions detect Python malware
    - Techniques to reduce the detection surface (e.g., obfuscation, syscall-based execution, etc...)

    descrete as possible ?? I started to look some techniques, maybe using Syscall for all the functions using Windows API, but i was far from that.
    So i started to play with the behavior of the malware. I added a simple *time.sleep(20)* in the dropper to see if it would work.
    And miraculously, Windows Defender wasn't able to detect it, even after few days. So we can confirm that statically, the keylogger bypasses Windows Defender.

    :green[One : PE HEADER FORMAT]
    
    Without the Rich Header, Windows Defender loses an identifier fragment, it can't make a relation (around the compilation chain) between
    the program and known malware for exemple. At this point, i didn't find information about why i can bypass 
    Windows Defender without the Rich Header, maybe this PE header fragment has no importance during static analysis (performed by Windows Defender). 
    At this stage, it's more  a deduction than a certainty, so take it with a pinch of salt. 
    
    
    :green[Two : OBFUSCATION CODE:]
    
    The second possiblity is the use of LLVM front-end. The C code (traduce by Nuitka from the python source code) will be transform
    in a Intermediate Representation and it can help to obfuscate the code. Nuitka will "traduce" the python code using libpython and the 
    intermediate code is very hard to read. It can be use as an obfuscation, additionally, the junk code will help because it will be also 
    "traduce" by Nuitka. But the thing is, only the dropper is compilate, and that's
    why our third hypothesis is...
    
      
    :green[Three : NUITKA, C and LIBPYTHON:]
    
    The traduce-by-Nuitka dropper will use libpython for interpreting the code. It will execute it direclty into the memory, 
    that can bypass AV detection. Windows Defender (in our scope) is file-dependent and need visibility to avoid threat. That why
    the dynamic code can easily bypass the AV. 
    
    :green[Four: TECHNIQUE IMPORT:]
    
    To import module, i used importlib. He will import library dynamically, so during the code execution. You will see how it works below 
    with the dropper code. 
    
    :blue[Of course, the technic used previously in order to bypass dynamic analysis helped a lot. The mixe of all theses technics 
    make the python malware, capable to bypass a Windows Defender at home.]
